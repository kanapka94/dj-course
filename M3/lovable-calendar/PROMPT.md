Please build a nicely looking modern calendar view for a web application using React and tailwindCSS. The calendar should display the current month with days laid out in a grid format. Each day should be represented as a square that can contain events. Now there should be some mock data in the calendar and clicking on these events should open a small modal window with a very simple form that allows me to edit the data for this event and save it later on. Yeah, so the calendar should also include navigation buttons to move to the previous and next months. Additionally implement a feature that highlights the current day. Ensure that the design is responsive and looks good on both mobile and desktop.
