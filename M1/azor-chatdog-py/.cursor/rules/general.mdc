# Python Code Execution Rule
Always open (activate) the project's virtual environment before running any Python code. This ensures all dependencies are available and version conflicts are avoided.

**Activation command:**

```sh
source .venv/bin/activate
```

Run this command in your shell to activate the virtual environment before executing Python scripts or applications in this project.

# Colorama Usage Convention

The `colorama` library should **only** be used within `console.py`. Other files must use the public functions from `console.py` for colored output.

**Key principles:**
- `colorama` is a private implementation detail of `console.py`
- Import and use `console.print_info()`, `console.print_error()`, etc. instead of directly using colorama
- Do not import `Fore`, `Back`, `Style`, or any colorama classes outside of `console.py`
- This ensures consistent output formatting across the entire application
